# # Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

 I was motivated to do this, because i want to become better. I'm 33 and I wanted to do more with my life so i can be better for my wife, and our unborn daughter.

 I built this project to show myself i have what it takes to do this. I didnt just skip down to the bottom of each lesson and read the answeres. I took the time to do eveything myself.

What I promblem i sovled here was how to structure my prework notes on a webpage so that i can easily find and read the information.

This prework course helped me learn even more on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. The most helpful part is I figured out how to use Git, and how to send all my updated codes from my terminal to Git.

# Prework Study Guide

## Usage
The Prework Study Guide is designed to help individuals learn and reinforce their understanding of various fundamental topics essential for web development. Each section of the study guide covers specific subjects such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git, providing comprehensive notes and explanations. 

To get started, follow these steps:
1. Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.
2. The homepage will display an overview of the topics covered in the prework.
3. Access the DevTools console in your browser (press F12 or right-click and select "Inspect").
4. Upon opening the DevTools console, the JavaScript code will run and list all the topics learned during the prework.
5. The study guide will then suggest one topic for you to focus on first based on your progress.

You can navigate through the study guide by clicking on the links corresponding to each topic. Inside each section, you will find detailed notes, examples, and practical exercises to reinforce your understanding. Additionally, interactive coding challenges might be provided to test your skills and knowledge.

Feel free to use this Prework Study Guide as a valuable resource to enhance your web development skills and gain confidence in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. Happy learning!

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
